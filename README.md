### Abstract
This project involves fitting a mathematical model to a dataset using least-squares error. The model is of the form f(x) = Acos(Bx) + Cx + D, and the goal is to find the parameters A, B, C, and D that minimize the error between the model predictions and the actual data. The project also includes generating a 2D loss landscape by fixing two parameters and sweeping through values of the other two parameters. Additionally, the project involves fitting a line, parabola, and 19th degree polynomial to the data using the first 20 or first and last 10 data points as training data, and computing the least-square error for each model on the training and test data.

### Sec. I. Introduction and Overview
#### Introduction:

Data modeling is an important tool used in many fields, including engineering, physics, economics, and computer science. One popular approach to data modeling is fitting mathematical models to data using least-squares error. This involves finding the parameters of the model that minimize the error between the model predictions and the actual data. In this project, we explore this approach by fitting a mathematical model to a dataset and analyzing the results.

#### Overview:

In the first part of the project, we use the numpy library to define a dataset and a mathematical model of the form f(x) = Acos(Bx) + Cx + D. We then use the scipy library to fit the model to the data using least-squares error and find the parameters A, B, C, and D that minimize the error.

In the second part of the project, we generate a 2D loss landscape by fixing two parameters of the model and sweeping through values of the other two parameters. We use the matplotlib library to visualize the results in a grid and analyze the number of minima we find as we sweep through parameters.

In the third part of the project, we fit a line, parabola, and 19th degree polynomial to the data using the first 20 or first and last 10 data points as training data. We then compute the least-square error for each model on the training and test data.

Finally, we compare the results of fitting the models to the first 20 or first and last 10 data points and computing the least-square error on the test data. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and experimentation.

###  Sec. II. Theoretical Background

**Least-squares error** is a common method for fitting mathematical models to data. It involves finding the parameters of the model that minimize the sum of the squares of the differences between the model predictions and the actual data. This is represented mathematically as:

$$E = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (f(x_j) - y_j)^2}$$

where **E** is the least-square error, **n** is the number of data points, **x<sub>j</sub>** and **y<sub>j</sub>** are the j-th data point, and **f(x<sub>j</sub>)** is the prediction of the model for the j-th data point.

Machine learning and optimzation heavily involve finding optimal parameters that will result in the least possible error (or at least below a certain tolerance level). The ease and accuracy of finding these parameters relies on the type of model being used (linear vs nonlinear, convex vs concave...). On a linear model or a polynomial the solution is convex and therefore the parameters will be optimal and thus refer to the global minimum on the function of error. In this case, the initial guess is not needed since the convexity causes gradient descent to always move towards the global minimum because local minima do not exist on such a function. Hence, no matter where the optimization begins, its optimization path will always lead it to the global minimum. 

However, when the model, such as the one taken in this project **f(x) = Acos(Bx) + Cx + D**, is nonlinear, the number of solutions is unknown. An unknown number of solutions means that plenty of local minima may exist. This would mean that the optimization algorithm of gradient descent may get stuck at a local minimum thinking it has found a the global minimum. In this case, different initial guesses may produce results with more or less error. The reason for this is that now since the surface of error is no longer convex, the location of the inital guess will affect which local minimum the optimization gets stuck in first (assuming the guess does not lead to the global minimum). To elaborate, depending on the initial guess, the algorithm may get stuck in a local minimum that is higher (more error) than another local minimum that may have been lower (less error, i.e. closer to the global minimum).

Fixing two parameters and sweeping the other two across them to create a 2D loss (error) landscape can be useful for gaining insight into the behavior of the model function and identifying regions of parameter space where the model performs well or poorly.

By fixing two parameters and varying the other two, we can generate a grid of parameter combinations and calculate the corresponding errors or loss values. This allows us to visualize the relationship between the model's performance and the values of the two varying parameters, and identify regions of the parameter space where the model is particularly sensitive to changes in those parameters.

In addition, examining the 2D loss landscape can help us to identify the presence of multiple local minima in the optimization problem, which can affect the robustness and reliability of the model. By analyzing the loss landscape, we can gain insights into the global behavior of the model and make informed decisions about how to fine-tune the parameters to achieve optimal performance.

### Sec. III. Algorithm Implementation and Development

The implemenation began by studying the data given and it quickly became clear that a model function including cosine would make sense:

*Figure 1: Plot of data points X and Y*

Once the model function was down and the number of parameters was determined, a conventional approach was taken to find the 'optimal' parameters that would yield minimum error through least-sqaures error. First, a helper function, **LSE** (least-squares error), which would calculate the least-squares error given 4 parameters as an array_like object, **c**, the given input data set, **x**, and the given output data set, **y**.

```
def LSEfit(c, x, y):
    E = np.sqrt(np.sum((c[0]*np.cos(c[1]*x)+c[2]*x+c[3]-y)**2)/n)
    return E
```

Then, optimization was applied using the SciPy library's optimize module which was imported as opt:

```
# set the initial guess for the parameters
c0 = np.array([3, 1*np.pi/4, 2/3, 32])

# perform optimization
res = opt.minimize(LSEfit, c0, args=(X, Y), method='Nelder-Mead')

# get the optimized parameters
c = res.x
```
As previously mentioned, the initial guess will vary the results since this is a nonlinear model with an unknown number of solutions. The initial guess used was the best I could find after trial and error. Optimization was done using the **LSEFit** function mentioned above and the Nelder-Mead method. I used this method because it is useful for optimizing functions that are not differentiable or whose derivatives are difficult to compute, however, do note that this method is a popular choice for optimization problems with a small number of variables, but can become inefficient in high-dimensional spaces or if the function being optimized is highly nonlinear or has multiple local minima.

After the optimized parameters were found, the minimum error (the furthest down the optimization algorithm could go) was found by passing these optimized parameters through the **LSEFit** function. The results will be discussed in **section IV.**.


In the next part of the project, the previously found parameters were studied more deeeply. Two of the four parameters were fixed at their optimal value while the other two were swept from 0 to 30 and a 2D loss (error) landscape was generated. Consider the case where A and B were the fixed parameters and C and D were swept across:

```
# FIX A B
# Initialize error grid
error_gridAB = np.zeros((len(C_range), len(D_range)))

# Loop through C and D ranges and compute error for each combination
for i, C in enumerate(C_range):
    for j, D in enumerate(D_range):
        # Compute error for fixed A and B and swept C and D
        error = compute_error(A_fixed, B_fixed, C, D, X, Y)
        # Store error in error grid
        error_gridAB[i, j] = error

# Generate x and y meshes from the ranges of C and D
C_mesh, D_mesh = np.meshgrid(C_range, D_range)

# Create a new figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the error grid as a pcolor map
pcm = ax.pcolormesh(C_mesh, D_mesh, error_gridAB, cmap='viridis', shading='auto')

# Add a colorbar to the plot
plt.colorbar(pcm).set_label('Error', fontweight='bold')
```

Note that color meshes are particularly useful in visualizing 2D arrays or grids (as can be seen in **section IV.**, hence why they were used. The error was stored in a error grid to be plotted against the meshes generated from the swept ranges. 

The above process was repeated for all six combinations of two fixed and two swept parameters.


Next, the first 20 data points were used as training data to determine the coeficients to fit a line, parabola and 19th degree polynomial to the data. Then, using these coeficients, the prediction accuracy of the model was tested against the last 10 data points using the least-squares error equation:

```
# Fit a parabola to the data
parabola_coeffs = np.polyfit(X[:20], Y[:20], deg=2)
parabola_predictions_train = np.polyval(parabola_coeffs, X[:20])
parabola_error_train = np.sqrt(np.sum((Y[:20] - parabola_predictions_train) ** 2)/20)

# Compute errors on test data
parabola_predictions_test = np.polyval(parabola_coeffs, X[-10:])
parabola_error_test = np.sqrt(np.sum((Y[-10:] - parabola_predictions_test) ** 2)/10)
```

Since all three of these fits are polynomials, the optimal coefficients were found using Numpy library's **polyfit** method. An initial guess was not required for this method since polynomials have a known number of solutions and therefore it iteratively minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals between the data and the polynomial fit until it determines the best-fit coefficients.

Finally, the same procedure was done except the training data became the first 10 and last 10 data points and then this model was fit to the 10 held out middle points (test data). 

### Sec. IV. Computational Results

In the first part, it can be seen from the plot below that the resulting fit was not very accurate but still pretty close to emulating the flucuations of the given data points. The **minimum error** was determined to be around **1.593** while the 4 optimal parameters found were **A=2.17**, **B=0.91**, **C=0.73**, **D=31.45**.

*Figure 2: Fitting f(x) on X and Y using least-squares fit*


In the next part, the 2D loss (error) landscape's color maps yieled interesting results and provided insight to the affect certain parameters have on the function's number of minima.

*Figure 3: Error Landscape, fix AB and sweep CD*

In figure 3 we can see that the effect of C when A and B are fixed is very minimal. For the entire range of C, the color is almost the same whereas as D ranges from 15 to 45 the error increases dramatically from well below 100 to over 500. This shows that the value of D has a very big impact when A and B are fixed.

*Figure 4: Error Landscape, fix AC and sweep BD*

Figure 4 is very interesting because we can see that when A and C are fixed, the error tends to minimize the closer B gets to around 17. Note that this is true for D being between 15 and 45. At first glance it looks like D does not have any influence, however, some ripples can be noticed at values of around 22, 27, 34, and 41 for D. We can see that at these values of D, the error is very minimal when B is between 10 and 15.

*Figure 5: Error Landscape, fix AD and sweep BC*

In figure 5 we can see that the effect of C when A and D are fixed is very minimal. For the entire range of C, the color is almost the same whereas as B ranges from 0 to 30 the error increases dramatically from well below 100 to over 500. This shows that the value of B has a very big impact when A and D are fixed.

*Figure 6: Error Landscape, fix BC and sweep AD*

Figure 6 is a good example of what a convex error surface would look like. Notice how no matter what point we start with here, if we follow the color descent gradient we will always end up in the minimum error region that is well below 5. We can also see that this lowest error occurs at almost A=17 and D=18 when B and C are fixed to their optimal values.

*Figure 7: Error Landscape, fix BD and sweep AC*

In figure 7 we can see that the effect of C when B and D are fixed is very minimal. For the entire range of C, the color is almost the same whereas as A ranges from 0 to 30 the error increases dramatically from well below 100 to over 500. This shows that the value of A has a very big impact when B and D are fixed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116219100/231120679-7027a978-9c71-4eb3-8563-553a2a0a95e0.png)
*Figure 8: Error Landscape, fix BD and sweep AC*

Figure 8 is very interesting because we can see that when C and D are fixed, the error tends to minimize the closer B gets to around 0. Note that this is true for A being between 0 and 30. At first glance it looks like A does not have any influence, however, some ripples can be noticed at values of A. We can see that at these values of A, the error is very minimal, especially the closer B is to 0. It should also be noted that there are about 3 yellow lines showing that if A is at these values and B is closer to 30, the error increases by a good amount.


Moving on to testing different polynomial models against different sections of the data, we can see how training on different portions of the data leads to varying errors:

```
LINE MODEL, -Test End-:
Training Error: 2.242749386808539
Test Error: 3.4392356574390317

LINE MODEL, -Test Middle-:
Training Error: 1.8516699043293752
Test Error: 2.943490105614687


PARABOLA MODEL, -Test End-:
Training Error: 2.125539348277377
Test Error: 9.035130793088825

PARABOLA MODEL, -Test Middle-:
Training Error: 1.85083641159579
Test Error: 2.910426615782527


19th DEGREE POLYNOMIAL MODEL, -Test End-:
Training Error: 0.02835144302630829
Test Error: 30023572038.458946

19th DEGREE POLYNOMIAL MODEL, -Test Middle-:
Training Error: 0.16381508563760222
Test Error: 507.53804019224077
```

Recall that the given data points oscillate but still steadily increase as X increases.

For the line model, both types of tests yielded very low error in training and testing. However it seems that this model adapted better (although slim) to the version where we removed the middle values during training. This could be interpreted that since we are drawing a line here, the incline is what is important. The total incline can be better depicted by taking points in the beginning and then end of the entire data set and thus this would reduce error.

For the parabola model, the test error after training on the last 10 points was noticeably higher than that on the middle points. This could be interpreted that since the degree of curvature of a parabola will depend on future points, this was better captured when taking points in the beginning and then end of the entire data set and thus this would reduce error.

For the 19th degree polynomial model, the training error in both cases was almost nonexistent. This makes sense since a 19th degree polynomial can pass through all 10 data points with ease due to its degree. However, the test error was astronomical when testing the last 10 points and very large when testing the middle 10 points. This greatly descibes a phenomenon called overfitting. The model has been trained so strongly on the training data (by passing through each point) that when it is given data outside this data set its behaviour is very offset. The test on the middle points was definitely much better (although still not good) than the test on the end points. The interpretation for this is that since the problem here is overfitting, the gap presented by skipping the middle 10 points in training allows this model to be less overfit than its counterpart. The one tested on the first 20 points catches onto the given data points much more strongly and thus results in a much stronger effect of overfitting thus greatly increasing the error when the data changes from what the model was trained on.

### Sec. V. Summary and Conclusions

In this project, we explored the use of least-squares error and 2D loss landscapes for fitting a mathematical model to a dataset. We found that the Nelder-Mead method was effective in finding the optimal parameters for the model, and that the 2D loss landscape provided useful insights into the behavior of the model function and the sensitivity of the model to changes in the parameter values. We also found that the 19th degree polynomial was the best model for fitting this particular dataset, but that was only due to overfitting and caution should be exercised when extrapolating beyond the range of the data. Aditionally, we concluded how training data has a large effect on the flexibility and accuracy of a model. Overall, this project demonstrates the usefulness of data modeling and the power of mathematical models for analyzing and understanding complex datasets in machine learning.
